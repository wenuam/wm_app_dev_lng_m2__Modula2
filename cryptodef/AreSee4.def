(*
  create a new AreSee4 encryption object with the given key.
  the returned object is ready to encrypt/decrpyt data.

  Create
  the number of bytes in the key is keySize.

  Create2
  like Create except it uses the CHAR type as its array element.
  the key string cab be any length, including "".

  the implementation may not use all of the bytes in the key.
  the algorithm never uses more than 256 bytes for a key.

   only one thread at a time can use an encryption object.

PROCEDURE Reset(crypt : AreSee4);
(* reset the encryption object to encrypt a new data stream.
   you must reset the object before you encrypt/decrypt each unique data stream.
*)

PROCEDURE EnDeCrypt(crypt : AreSee4; input, output : ADDRESS; amount : CARDINAL);
(*
  encrypt/decrypt a block of data of size amount.
  you can encrypt/decrypt a large data stream in multiple smaller pieces
  using this call.
  you can pass the same variable to both input and output should you so desire.

  remember to reset the object before encryting/decrypting each unique data stream.

PROCEDURE SelfTest() : BOOLEAN;
(*
  returns TRUE if the implemented algorithm properly operates.
  this call is only useful when porting this code to some other processor/compiler.
