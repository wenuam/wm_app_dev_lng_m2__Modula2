  a generalized version of the PKCS #5 PBKDF1 key derivation function.
  see www.rsasecurity.com for the PCKS #5 document for details on the
  PBKDF1 function.

  saltLen = the length, in bytes, of the salt parameter.

  hashLen = the size in bytes of the hash function you are using.
      this value cannot be any larger than MaxHashLen.

  this function can accept any hash up to MaxHashLen.
      this means you can generate a derived key up to 512-bits (64-bytes).
          more than enough for an AES 256-bit key and 128-bit IV value = 384-bits.

  keyLen = the size, in bytes, of the key you want returned in derivedKey.

  returns TRUE if successful
  returns FALSE if
      keyLen > hashLen
      the size of password + saltLen is too large for an internal buffer.
          this is unlikely with typical passwords and salts.
