TYPE

PROCEDURE Create() : MD5;
(* create an MD5 hash object.
   the hash object is initialized when created.
   only one thread at a time can use a hash object.
*)

PROCEDURE Destroy(VAR OUT hash : MD5);
(* destroys a previously created MD5 hash object.
   hash = NIL after this call.
*)

PROCEDURE Reset(hash : MD5);
(* resets and initializes the hash object.
   after this you can hash bytes *)

PROCEDURE HashBytes(hash : MD5; data : ADDRESS; amount : CARDINAL);
(* adds bytes to hash *)

PROCEDURE Finalize(hash : MD5);
(* finalizes hash.
   you cannot hash additional bytes after a hash has been finalized.
*)

PROCEDURE GetHash(hash : MD5; VAR OUT data : ARRAY OF BYTE);
(* a MD5 hash is 16 bytes.
   data is an open array so that you can implement a single buffer
   large enough to hold different hashes, each of which is likely a different
   size in bytes.
   this call will Finalize the hash if it has not yet been finalized.
*)

PROCEDURE GetString(hash : MD5; VAR OUT str : ARRAY OF CHAR);
(* the string returned is 32 characters long.
   this call will Finalize the hash if it has not yet been finalized.
*)

PROCEDURE SelfTest() : BOOLEAN;
(*
  returns TRUE if the implemented algorithm properly operates.
  this call is only useful when porting this code to some other processor/compiler.
*)

END MD5.
